# Text-to-Image Conversion Application

Name: Amulya Kumar Padhan\
Company: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS\
Domain: Machine learning\
Duration: June 1st to June 30th

## Overview
This project aims to develop a text-to-image generation application that transforms textual descriptions into visual representations using generative model ML API. The application provides users with the capability to input descriptive text and generate corresponding images, leveraging advancements in machine learning techniques.

## Live Demo
The project is deployed and can be accessed at: [Text-to-Speech Converter](https://ttsconverter.pythonanywhere.com/)


## Features
- Input textual descriptions for image generation.
- Utilizes generative model based ML API for creating images.
- Downloadable images in standard formats.
- Automatic cleanup of old audio files.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x or 4.x
- ML API for text-to-image conversion
- HTML/CSS (Bootstrap for styling)
- JavaScript (jQuery)
- Git (for version control)
- Virtual environment tool like `venv` or `virtualenv` (recommended)

## Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amulyakpadhan/CODTECH-Internship-Task2.git
cd CODTECH-Internship-Task2
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
# For Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install the required packages
```

### Step 4: Configure Django Settings
Ensure your Django settings are configured properly:

- Set ALLOWED_HOSTS to include your local development domain.
- Configure DATABASES to use a suitable database (e.g., SQLite for development).
- Ensure MEDIA_ROOT and STATIC_ROOT are properly set to handle media files and static files.

### Step 5: Run Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate  # Apply database migrations
```

### Step 6: Create a Superuser (Admin Account)
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser  # Create an admin account
```
### Step 7: Start the Django Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver  # Start the Django development server
```
Now, you can access the project by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.

## Usage
- Open the application in your browser.
